# Color-Palettes

## Description
This is a collection of color palettes used for reference during the design and production of 3D parts.

The color references are accurate as of the time they were committed.  Manufacturers change their palettes from time to time, so no guarantees are made regarding **current** availability or accuracy.

The palettes are initially available as [Apple Color List](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DrawColor/Concepts/AboutColorLists.html) files because that is the system I work on. 

## Organization
1. Each manufacturer has its own folder.
2. Each product has its own file.
